# SmartRecipe: Design Document

## 1. Overview

SmartRecipe is a data-driven solution designed to offer personalized recipe recommendations. By integrating text searches, user profiling, and machine learning, it offers a seamless experience for finding the best recipes tailored to individual needs.

## 2. Motivation

In the age of personalized experiences, SmartRecipe caters to a growing demand for tailored culinary suggestions. With varied dietary preferences and the evolving landscape of global cuisines, a tool that personalizes recipe suggestions can revolutionize culinary exploration.

## 3. Success Metrics

- Increase in user engagement by 25% post-launch.
- Achieve a 10% conversion from recipe suggestion to actual cooking.
- Maintain a user satisfaction rate of 90% and above.

## 4. Requirements & Constraints

### Functional:

1. Recipe searches with <2 sec response times.
2. Tailored suggestions based on user history.
3. Dietary restriction filters.

### Non-functional:

1. Scalability for up to 1M users.
2. GDPR compliant data handling.
3. Robust security measures against breaches.

### Constraints:
